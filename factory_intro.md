# Welcome to AFI‑Factory

This is the AFI Protocol’s production layer for agent templates.  
Templates here can be spawned into real agents by Factory.ai droids or `afi-cli`.

Each template should:
- Have a unique ID
- Declare its logic entrypoint
- Be listed in `agent_manifest.json`

You may add tests, inputs, and signal logic later as needed. For now, think of this like an intelligent scaffolding service.
